2. **pytest_sessionfinish(session, exitstatus)**: Called at the end of a test session, before returning the exit status to the operating system.
3. **pytest_unconfigure(config)**: Called before pytest finalizes the test session.

### **Modification and Customization Hooks**

1. **pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items)**: Called after test collection has been performed. Allows modification of the list of collected items.
2. **pytest_itemcollected(item)**: Called when an individual test item is collected.

### **Exception Handling Hooks**

1. **pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)**: Called when an exception is raised that terminates a test execution. It allows plugins to alter the traceback or handle the exception in a specific way.

### **Miscellaneous Hooks**

2. **pytest_itemstart(item, nodeid, captured)**: (deprecated) Was used to signal the start of running a single test item.
